# Data Analytics - Diabetes Predictions - Classification Model

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

Project can be seen in my [Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/SpringChhom/DA_Project4_Diabetes_Classification_Model/blob/main/SpringChhom_DataAnalytics_Project4_Diabetes_Classification_Model.ipynb)  

The Dataset:
The Akimel O'otham, formerly known as the Pima, are an indengeous tribe living in Arizona along the Gila River. Although the incidence rate of type 2 diabetes has been found to be high amongst North American indegenous populations, the Akimel O'otham have had the highest rates in the world since the 1960s as well as earlier onset of the disease than the general population. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has conducted extensive research on diabetes in this community since 1965. Part of that reseach has included medical data collected on Akimel O'otham females over 21 years of age in order to study possible indicators of diabetes and then predict future onset of type 2 diabetes.

The Analysis:
This dataset contains variables that have already been found to be related to the onset of Type 2 Diabetes. Therefore, the task here is to determine how well these measurable variables can predict a diagnosis of diabetes in the patient within the next five years. Because we know what outcomes we are looking for, a positive or negative diagnosis of diabetes, this is an example of supervised learning, where we can train a classification model to predict the outcome in a measured and controlled way. The question is, how accurate and useful might this model be?

Ethical Considerations:
There are multiple layers of ethics to consider with this dataset and its analysis. First and foremost is the long term effects that colonization of North America has had on the indigenous populations such as the Akimel O'otham, and those effects do include the extremely high rates of Type 2 Diabetes in their community today. We all, governments, institutions and citizens, have a responsibility to do what we can to decrease these effects and increase the long term health of those affected. One way to do that is to use a dataset such as this to initiate change.
Another consideration is to continue to build datasets such as this for future futher analysis and benficial usage. This is another way to ethically make positive change.
Something important to consider in continuing to gather and store that data though is to make sure the individuals providing the data are fully protected in terms of privacy and safety. All personal information should be removed from the data.
Also crucial is to minize bias in collecting, analyzing and modeling with the data. This can be tricky with such a specific dataset but one priority is that methods of collecting, analyzing, modeling and reporting on this data should be devoid of judgement. Bias can also come into play when choosing which variables to measure and collect, so all efforts should be made to thoroughly research and consult experts to determine the optimal choices. In choosing to use this dataset, I chose to keep all of this in mind and to follow it to the best of my abilities.
